# Quantitative Finance – Heavy Equipment Sector 📊🚜

<p align="justify">This repository contains a collection of <b>quantitative finance projects</b> focused on <b>Heavy Equipment stocks</b>, with a primary case study on <b>Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)</b>.  
The goal of this project is to explore <b>trading strategies, portfolio optimization, asset allocation, and time series forecasting</b> using Python and Jupyter Notebook.</p>

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Apply **quantitative finance concepts** to real market data
- Analyze price behavior of heavy equipment companies
- Backtest common **technical trading strategies**
- Perform **portfolio optimization and asset allocation**
- Explore **time series forecasting** for stock prices

<p align="justify"><b>Asset allocation</b> is the process of distributing investment capital across different assets to balance risk and return based on investment objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
By combining assets with different risk characteristics and correlations, asset allocation helps diversify portfolios, reduce volatility, and improve risk-adjusted performance, often having a greater impact on long-term results than individual security selection.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Bollinger Bands Strategy</b> is a technical trading strategy that uses <b>Bollinger Bands</b>—consisting of a moving average (middle band) and two bands set at a fixed number of standard deviations above and below it—to identify overbought and oversold market conditions. Traders typically buy when the price touches or falls below the lower band (potential oversold condition) and <b>sell</b> when the price touches or rises above the upper band (potential overbought condition), using the bands to gauge volatility and potential price reversals.</p>

<img src="https://github.com/Bayunova28/Quantitative-Finance-Heavy-Equipment/blob/main/image/MACD_Strategy.png" height="550" width="1000">
<p align="justify"><b>MACD Strategy</b> is a momentum-based trading strategy that uses the <b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)</b> indicator to identify trend direction and potential buy or sell signals. The strategy generates a buy signal when the MACD line crosses above the signal line (bullish momentum) and a sell signal when it crosses below the signal line (bearish momentum), helping traders capture changes in price momentum and trend strength.</p>

<img src="https://github.com/Bayunova28/Quantitative-Finance-Heavy-Equipment/blob/main/image/RSI_BBAND_Strategy.png" height="550" width="1000">
<p align="justify"><b>RSI + Bollinger Bands Strategy</b> is a combined technical trading approach that uses the <b>Relative Strength Index (RSI)</b> and <b>Bollinger Bands</b> to confirm entry and exit signals. A buy signal typically occurs when the price touches or breaks below the lower Bollinger Band while the RSI indicates an <b>oversold condition</b> (e.g., RSI < 30). A <b>sell signal</b> occurs when the price touches or rises above the upper Bollinger Band while the RSI signals an <b>overbought condition</b> (e.g., RSI > 70). By combining momentum (RSI) and volatility (Bollinger Bands), this strategy aims to reduce false signals and improve trade reliability.</p>

<img src="https://github.com/Bayunova28/Quantitative-Finance-Heavy-Equipment/blob/main/image/pairs_trading.png" height="550" width="1000">
<p align="justify"><b>Pairs Trading</b> is a market-neutral trading strategy that exploits the <b>relative price relationship between two correlated or cointegrated assets</b>. The strategy involves <b>going long the undervalued asset</b> and short the overvalued asset when their price spread deviates from its historical mean, with the expectation that the spread will revert back over time. By focusing on relative performance rather than market direction, pairs trading aims to generate returns while reducing overall market risk.</p>

<img src="https://github.com/Bayunova28/Quantitative-Finance-Heavy-Equipment/blob/main/image/portfolio_optimization.png" height="550" width="1000">
<p align="justify"><b>Portfolio Optimization</b> is a quantitative framework for constructing portfolios that achieve the <b>best possible risk–return trade-off</b> under different investment constraints. As illustrated by the <b>efficient frontier</b>, the optimization compares <b>long-only, short-allowed</b>, and <b>leveraged</b> portfolios, showing how relaxing constraints can expand the opportunity set and potentially increase expected returns for a given level of volatility.</p>
